### Intro  
It's true! At the beginner to moderate hobbyist coder, pointers are just trouble ðŸ˜®

So you asked "What about pointers, Ralph?". And I kept telling you, "Not needed". I was finally brow-beaten, er, sorry, _persuaded_ to show you the difference between C++ user-friendly References and C-style, hard-to-decipher (and use) Pointers.

It is, of course, good to know about pointers, as other people's code might be full of them. Especially libraries, ported from the C language. But it doesn't mean you should be tempted to use them when we have References available.

Unless you know differently? Your views in the comments, please!
